          <h3>Course 1: Network Fundamentals</h3>
          <p>
            This course introduces the basic concepts of computer networking.
            Topics include network topologies, protocols, and devices like
            routers and switches. I'll learn how data is transferred across
            networks, understand the OSI model, and configure basic network
            settings. Key skills developed include setting up a home network,
            troubleshooting connectivity issues, and understanding network
            security fundamentals.
