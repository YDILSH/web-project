# My First Year at UniSA - Web Development Project


## Project Description

A structured website project that showcases my first-year experiences at the University of South Australia. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project includes multiple interactive pages, user preferences, and a secure to-do list. This web project provides an engaging view of my initial year at university, highlighting the courses I’m studying, my goals, and my progress. It combines design and interactivity to enhance user experience, while demonstrating my web development skills.

### Purpose and Technologies
- **Purpose**: To create a multi-page website that shares my academic journey while exploring essential web development principles like theming, storage, and interactivity.
- **Technologies Used**: 
  - **HTML**: For structuring content.
  - **CSS**: To style and theme the pages.
  - **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity, handling user inputs and buttons.

### Challenges & Future Enhancements
- **Challenges**: Implementing the dynamic theme toggle and securing the to-do list with password protection were complex but rewarding aspects of this project.
- **Future Enhancements**: I aim to expand the to-do list functionality with person base saving and acess it again.
