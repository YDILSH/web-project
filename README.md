# My First Year at UniSA - Web Development Project


## Project Description

A structured website project that showcases my first-year experiences at the University of South Australia. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project includes multiple interactive pages, user preferences, and a secure to-do list. This web project provides an engaging view of my initial year at university, highlighting the courses Iâ€™m studying, my goals, and my progress. It combines design and interactivity to enhance user experience, while demonstrating my web development skills.

### Purpose and Technologies
- **Purpose**: To create a multi-page website that shares my academic journey while exploring essential web development principles like theming, storage, and interactivity.
- **Technologies Used**: 
  - **HTML**: For structuring content.
  - **CSS**: To style and theme the pages.
  - **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity, handling user inputs and buttons.

### Challenges & Future Enhancements
- **Challenges**: Implementing the dynamic theme toggle and securing the to-do list with password protection were complex but rewarding aspects of this project.
- **Future Enhancements**: I aim to expand the to-do list functionality with person base saving and acess it again.
